## 🧑‍💻 About me
Hello! My name is Alex, I'm 20 years old and I am frontend developer.
My current location is Tbilisi, Georgia, English level is about B2.

 I can build adaptive css layouts using preproccesors, write semantic and accesible HTML, create Web Applications with Javascript and React.

I also design UX/UI, so all projects from portfolio were fully created by myself from scratch :)

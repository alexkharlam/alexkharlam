## 🧑‍💻 About me
Hello! My name is Alex, I'm 20 years old and I am frontend developer.
My current location is Tbilisi, Georgia, English level is about B2.

 I build adaptive css layouts using preproccesors, write semantic and accesible HTML, create Web Applications with Javascript.

I also design UX/UI, so all projects from portfolio were fully created by myself from nothing :)

Please visit my [portfolio website](alexkharlam.dev) to get a full picture of what I can do😉.

## 🔧 Stack of technology
Here is only stuff that I know and worked with, while building websites/web apps

🟢  **Javascript** (ES6), **HTML, CSS**                                                                                                                      
🟢  **SASS** (scss syntax)                                                                            
🟢  **Post CSS**  
🟢  **Webpack**

🟢  **Git**  
🟢  **MVC architecture**
